    WAKE was initially conceived as a landing page for this website - and then adapted as a gallery installation. Inspired by a half remembered mental image of water falling on a lake - the interactive piece invites the viewer to draw their own
    serene patterns on the wall, creating a space for meditative reflection.

    Written in p5js, it was originally designed to be controlled by a standard mouse, but I felt that keeping that mode of interaction would be inappropriate for a gallery space, so I built a minimalist joystick module to invite user interaction with
    the piece.

    The Joystick added a layer of complication to the piece, its blocky eight-directional feel contrasted with the flow of the animation it was controlling. A comment on the way that technology restricts us from interacting freely with the world
    around us. (The previous sentence may or may not be bullshit).

    The piece represents a first step into a medium that I am very interested in exploring the limits of - Interactive Animation.
