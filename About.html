<h1>About</h1>


<h5>
  In recent years, it has become increasingly obvious that wheels of progress have ensconced themselves in a particularly nasty pile of slush. It really shouldn’t that big a deal - this kind of thing happens in history -  the problem is that our reaction as a society has been mostly indistinguishable from that that of a stressed out dad who, late for work, kids fighting in the back seat, just floors it, clutching in vain to the hope that doing so will somehow result in an outcome other than digging his wheels deeper into the morass. If we want to prevent this frazzled father figure from spinning his wheels until the car is window deep, the role of an artist is crystal clear - get the man to take a deep breath and get his foot off the damn gas pedal!  
</h5>

<h5>
  Of course, I personally don’t know how to dig us out of this mess, that one’s definitely beyond my paygrade. What I do know is that our culture has become so obsessed with goal setting and progress that many of us fail to notice that their wheels have no traction, and many more are so hysterical that they are becoming a danger to themselves and others. So as far as I’m concerned, at least in this country, we ought to take a moment to collect our thoughts before we do something stupid and accidentally run over one of the kids.

  I consider it politically imperative for artists to do something about this situation. That said, being wary of adding to the noise, I find myself driven to make art that induces a deep breath. Art that pops people out of their internal monologue and frees up space in their eyes to the beauty around them.

  This philosophy has led me down a number of interellated paths, pursuing a greater understanding of the multiverse of interconnected mediums that make up our daily existence. I started off playing music and touring in bands. Looking for different ways to communicate with our audience, I started creating animated music videos for our songs. Other bands asked me to work on their Music Videos, and eventually I started getting hired for commercial work, to making animations for some amazing companies, such as The Studio, Idealist, and Matte Finish.

 After several years of working on a freelance basis, I decided to pursue MFA in Interactive Art at Pratt Institute, which has given me the opportunty to further refine my skillset and my practive under the guidance of set of incredible artist and educators. I want to work on large scale immersive installations and interactive set design, and if you are of a similar mind, I would love help make your project happen.
